It was founded in accordance with the U​nited Nations Global Defense Act (UNGDA), on the date of 12 October 1995, as a united military force for global peacekeeping. The GDI's initial goal was to preserve world order by combating global terrorism, epitomized by its nemesis the Brotherhood of Nod, but eventually outgrew its original mandate to become a world government. After the end of the Second Tiberium War, and the decrease in Nod activities, GDI's new focus resulted in a decrease in outlays for new conventional weapon systems. At the same time, investment in space programs for both civilian and military use has exploded.<br>
                      <br>GDI adopted a military strategy that relies on a mix of very high-end weapons and command and control systems in space coupled with cost-effective force projection on the ground. With highly advanced space assets, including an upgraded Ion Cannon network, drop pods, orbital artillery deployment, and other space-based weapons and intelligence systems, supporting ground forces equipped with basic weapon systems that are rugged, reliable, and relatively inexpensive to produce and maintain.<br>
                      <br>GDI forces are organized to allow decentralized operations in multiple theaters of war. GDI rapid-deployment forces are able to move quickly, establish forward-operating bases in all types of terrain, and project power using advanced all-weather weapon systems and highly trained troops.

While their arsenal is comprised largely of high-tech weaponry, their upgrades and special abilities allow them to adapt to different situations. They are the easiest faction for newcomers to learn.<br>
                      <br>After building a power plant, and then a barracks, the player gains access to enlist squads of riflemen. They are the basic GDI infantry unit.&nbsp;They are effective against other infantry, and perform reasonably in scouting and anti-scouting. They are trained with the ability to build a Foxhole in the selected location. When it is finished, they automatically garrison it.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>The player may also enlist a Missile squad a slow duo of soldiers wielding missile launchers, inneffective against infantry, used for attacking mechanical units like enemy tanks and patrol craft.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>The last unit a GDI barracks can innately procure is an engineer, it comes out as a single unit instead of a squad unlike the Rifle and Missile squad. ​Slow and unarmed, the Engineer is nonetheless important in his own right. Engineers are the only units able to capture enemy structures, and now they can take over downed large mechs including the Juggernaut, the Avatar, and the Annihilator Tripod. Tactical use of Engineers is considered an art among many commanders. They can be used to capture civilian structures and repair destroyed bridges or to repair friendly structures. Note that with each of these actions, the Engineer is lost.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>You must build a command post, which can call in paratroopers, in order to enlist Grenadier squadrons, a command post needs an active power plant and refinery in order to be built.<br>Grenadier squadrons cost twice as much as a Missile squad, costing $800. It comes in a squad of 4 grenadiers, that are effective against infantry compositions, buildings, and can instantly kill any garrisonned building<br>
                      <br>Sniper teams require an armory to be active in order to enlist in battle. The armory can replace the fallen units of a squad, and can paradrop snipers into battle, of course, with a price. Sniper teams consist of a spotter and a sniper, both of which can take out enemy infantry instantly, and from a long range as well. They have the ability to provide extra range for juggernauts, the faction's long range artillery.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>Zone troopers are heavy infantry dressed in armor suitable to traverse most medium and some red zones, which are infested with tiberium. They cost $1300, comes in a squad of 4, and requires a tech center to be built, which acts like an upgrade building. They don upon jetpacks that can be used momentarily to traverse a short-medium distance, and can jump over map obstacles. Their heavy-duty railguns can decimate enemy vehicles and buildings. They cannot enter garrisons but they cannot be crushed by enemy tanks.<br>
                      <br>The last Infantry unit&nbsp; which requires both an active armory and a tech center, the commando. The commando is a hero unit, hero units can only be enlisted once per faction, you can create multiple hero units from a captured enemy barracks. The commando is stronger than most infantry, they cannot be crushed, they take more punishment than the average rifleman. Their rapid-fire rail-rifle instantly kills any infantry unit it shoots at. They're equipped with a faster jetpack. Their explosives can demolish structures in seconds, and can instantly destroy walkers like the Juggernaut, which its husk can be captured by an engineer.&nbsp;<br>

                    <p class="u-text u-text-custom-color-1 u-text-default u-text-5">Upon building a war factory a GDI commander may produce Pitbulls, a $700 dollar scout vehicle. Although the Pitbull, GDI’s primary scout vehicle, can fire missiles capable of damaging aircraft and lighter vehicles, it is too lightly armoured to survive direct combat. Because of its speed, it is often used in hit-and-run attacks and Harvester harrasment. The Pitbull also has the ability to detect stealthed units such as the Nod harverster.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>You could spend that $700 on a Guardian APC, which acts like a mobile garrison that can only fit a single squad. That squad can shoot out of its firing ports, which can prove quite useful for grenadiers.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>You can also spend $1100 on Predator tanks. The GDI's main battle tank, in numbers it can reduce bases to dust and shred enemy vehicles to scrap. It can withstand heavy plating but its shells are ineffective against infantry and cannot hit aircraft. It can however run over people.<br>
                      <br>GDI harvesters are recognizable for having a mounted machine gun on it, which can save itself from enemy infantry if need be. They collect tiberium from the ground, then deposit it to a nearby refinery, which gives the player money.<br>
                      <br>Mobile Construction Units, or MCVs can move and deploy into a Construction yard, which adds another building to be built simultaneously, it is well armored but unarmed and slow, without any construction yards, you might as well surrender.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>After building a command post, you can create rigs, which are similar to MCVs, due to its slow speed and having no way to defend itself. When it deploys, it transforms into a battle base, which provides considerable defence with two integrated Guardian Cannons, which are good against infantry and great against vehicles,&nbsp;a missile launcher, stealth detection scanners and automated repair drones, which repair significantly faster than the ones at a war factory. They're used as a nearby point of rest for your vehicles.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>Then the Zone troope equivalent, requiring an active tech center, costing in $1500, taking 45 seconds to creater, The Mammoth Tank. Armed with dual cannons and rocket pods, the Mammoth Tank is the ultimate in armoured warfare. Although slow, the Mammoth Tank is so powerful it can crush heavy infantry and lesser vehicles beneath its treads. It is very effective against vehicles and structures, and fares against aircraft moderately well. It is a staple of the competitive scene, as most players build Mammoths instead of Predators in the late game.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>The Juggernaut is a walker mech, which outranges enemy defenses and can deal huge damage to groups and buildings. GDI’s walking artillery platform can support tanks with its long-range cannons and serve as a siege weapon when stationed outside an enemy base, and bombard targets with the aid of Sniper Teams. They can also crush heavy infantry and lesser vehicles. When badly damaged, Juggernauts leave a husk that can be captured by Engineers (or their equivalents) of any side.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
